### Method 1 - Using [Dotkeeper](https://codeberg.org/StikyPiston/dotkeeper)

Firstly, ensure you have **Dotkeeper** installed. Install **Dotkeeper** with:

```bash
brew install stikypiston/formulae/dotkeeper
```

Then, run `dotkeeper fetch https://github.com/StikyPiston/cosmos-hypr`

To activate the rice, ensure all dependencies are installed, and run `dotkeeper activate cosmos-hypr`

### Method 2 - Manual Install
